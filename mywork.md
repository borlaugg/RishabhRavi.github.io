Hi! Sorry I haven't updated this, here's my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf) instead

## 2D mapping system for an Enhanced features for corrosion monitoring product
The problem at hand asks us to devise a mechanism that will remotely map the path/terrain a droid tracks. This is similar to the SLAM problem of localizing and mapping the surrounding as an autonomous vehicle moves. The droid being moved manually removes the problem of an autonomous drive. We only need to 'sense' our surroundings and transmit the readings to a base station. Alternatively, we could track the droid's movement, keeping track of its 'pose' and 'movement'. This will help us mathematically model the droid's motion in a 2D plane using Newtons's equations. Once we have an estimate of the path the droid traces, the mapping will involve plotting this on a graph.
