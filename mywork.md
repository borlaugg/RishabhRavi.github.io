Hi! Sorry I haven't updated this; here's my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf) instead



## Cache Security From Side Channel Attacks
Studied the vulnerabilities of shared cache and attacks like Flush+Reload, and Prime+Probe. Replicated the work of PASS-P, an algorithm that mitigates the threat of such hardware attacks. Implemented a modified PASS-P algorithm by introducing a more effective and dynamic insertion policy -DAAIP. The detailed report can be found [here](/assets/Rishabh_200260041_RnD_report.pdf).

## 2D mapping system for Corrosion Monitoring Product
The problem asks us to devise a mechanism to map the path/terrain droid tracks remotely. This is similar to the SLAM problem of localizing and mapping the surrounding as an autonomous vehicle moves. The droid being moved manually removes the problem of an autonomous drive. We only need to 'sense' our surroundings and transmit the readings to a base station. Alternatively, we could track the droid's movement, keeping track of its 'pose' and 'movement'. This will help us mathematically model the droid's motion in a 2D plane using Newtons's equations. Once we have an estimate of the path the droid traces, the mapping will involve plotting this on a graph.
