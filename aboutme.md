Hi! My name is Rishabh.                                     
I'm an undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, pursuing a B.Tech degree in the department of Electrical Engineering.             
I love playing football and play for my university, although I don't really watch much of it, but I do enjoy watching murder mystery movies/documentaries.


If you're wondering 'why borluagg?' you are right in asking so                              
Honestly, I have no idea why younger me chose to use it. People keep asking me about it and has since has worked as an excellent conversation starter :)
