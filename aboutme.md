Hi! My name is Rishabh.                                     
I'm an undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, pursuing a B.Tech degree in the department of Electrical Engineering.             
I love playing football and play for my university, although I don't really watch much of it.                    
If you enjoy watching murder mystery movies/documentaries, could you please recommend some :)
