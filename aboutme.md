Hi! My name is Rishabh.                             
I'm an undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, pursuing a Dual Degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering.             
I love playing football and playing for my university, although I don't watch much of it. However, I do enjoy watching murder mystery movies/documentaries.


If you're wondering 'Why Borlaugg?' you are right in asking so                              
Honestly, I do no know why the younger me used it. People keep asking me about it, and it has since worked as an excellent conversation starter :)
